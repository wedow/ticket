# ticket

The git-backed issue tracker for AI agents. Rooted in the Unix Philosophy, `tk` is inspired by Joe Armstrong's [Minimal Viable Program](https://joearms.github.io/published/2014-06-25-minimal-viable-program.html) with additional quality of life features for managing and querying against complex issue dependency graphs.

`tk` was written as a full replacement for [beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads). It shares many similar commands but without the need for keeping a SQLite file in sync or a rogue background daemon mangling your changes. It ships with a `migrate-beads` command to make this a smooth transition.

Tickets are markdown files with YAML frontmatter in `.tickets/`. This allows AI agents to easily search them for relevant content without dumping ten thousand character JSONL lines into their context window.

Using ticket IDs as file names also allows IDEs to quickly navigate to the ticket for you. For example, you might run `git log` in your terminal and see something like:

```
nw-5c46: add SSE connection management 
```

VS Code allows you to Ctrl+Click or Cmd+Click the ID and jump directly to the file to read the details.

## Install

**Homebrew (macOS/Linux):**
```bash
brew tap wedow/tools
brew install ticket
```

**Arch Linux (AUR):**
```bash
yay -S ticket  # or paru, etc.
```

**From source (auto-updates on git pull):**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wedow/ticket.git
cd ticket && ln -s "$PWD/ticket" ~/.local/bin/tk
```

**Or** just copy `ticket` to somewhere in your PATH.

## Requirements

`tk` is a portable bash script requiring only coreutils, so it works out of the box on any POSIX system with bash installed. The `query` command requires `jq`. Uses `rg` (ripgrep) if available, falls back to `grep`.

## Agent Setup

Add this line to your `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`:

```
This project uses a CLI ticket system for task management. Run `tk help` when you need to use it.
```

Claude Opus picks it up naturally from there. Other models may need additional guidance.

## Usage

```bash
tk - minimal ticket system with dependency tracking

    --design               Design notes
    --acceptance           Acceptance criteria
    -t, --type             Type (bug|feature|task|epic|chore) [default: task]
    -p, --priority         Priority 0-4, 0=highest [default: 2]
    -a, --assignee         Assignee [default: git user.name]
    --external-ref         External reference (e.g., gh-123, JIRA-456)
    --parent               Parent ticket ID
    --tags                 Comma-separated tags (e.g., --tags ui,backend,urgent)
  start <id>               Set status to in_progress
  close <id>               Set status to closed
  reopen <id>              Set status to open
  status <id> <status>     Update status (open|in_progress|closed)
  dep <id> <dep-id>        Add dependency (id depends on dep-id)
  dep tree [--full] <id>   Show dependency tree (--full disables dedup)
  dep cycle                Find dependency cycles in open tickets
  undep <id> <dep-id>      Remove dependency
  link <id> <id> [id...]   Link tickets together (symmetric)
  unlink <id> <target-id>  Remove link between tickets
  ls|list [--status=X] [-a X] [-T X]   List tickets
  ready [-a X] [-T X]      List open/in-progress tickets with deps resolved
  blocked [-a X] [-T X]    List open/in-progress tickets with unresolved deps
  closed [--limit=N] [-a X] [-T X] List recently closed tickets (default 20, by mtime)
  show <id>                Display ticket
  edit <id> [--children]   Open ticket in $EDITOR (--children includes descendants)
  add-note <id> [text]     Append timestamped note (or pipe via stdin)
  query [jq-filter]        Output tickets as JSON, optionally filtered
  migrate-beads            Import tickets from .beads/issues.jsonl

Searches parent directories for .tickets/ (override with TICKETS_DIR env var)
Supports partial ID matching (e.g., 'tk show 5c4' matches 'nw-5c46')
```

## Testing

The tests are written in the Behavior-Driven Development library [behave](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and require Python.

If you have `uv` [installed](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) simply:

```sh
make test
```

## Migrating from Beads

```bash
tk migrate-beads

# review new files if you like
git status

# check state matches expectations
tk ready
tk blocked

# compare against
bd ready
bd blocked

# all good, let's go
git rm -rf .beads
git add .tickets
git commit -am "ditch beads"
```
