Feature: Ticket Query
  As a user
  I want to query tickets as JSON
  So that I can process ticket data programmatically

  Background:
    Given a clean tickets directory

  Scenario: Query all tickets as JSONL
    Given a ticket exists with ID "query-001" and title "First ticket"
    And a ticket exists with ID "query-002" and title "Second ticket"
    When I run "ticket query"
    Then the command should succeed
    And the output should be valid JSONL
    And the output should contain "query-001"
    And the output should contain "query-002"

  Scenario: Query with jq filter
    Given a ticket exists with ID "query-001" and title "Open ticket"
    And a ticket exists with ID "query-002" and title "Closed ticket"
    And ticket "query-002" has status "closed"
    When I run "ticket query '.status == \"open\"'"
    Then the command should succeed
    And the output should contain "query-001"
    And the output should not contain "query-002"

  Scenario: Query includes all fields
    Given a ticket exists with ID "query-001" and title "Full ticket"
    When I run "ticket query"
    Then the command should succeed
    And the JSONL output should have field "id"
    And the JSONL output should have field "status"
    And the JSONL output should have field "deps"
    And the JSONL output should have field "links"
    And the JSONL output should have field "type"
    And the JSONL output should have field "priority"

  Scenario: Query with no tickets
    When I run "ticket query"
    Then the output should be empty

  Scenario: Query arrays are JSON arrays
    Given a ticket exists with ID "query-001" and title "Deps ticket"
    And a ticket exists with ID "query-002" and title "Dependency"
    And ticket "query-001" depends on "query-002"
    When I run "ticket query"
    Then the command should succeed
    And the JSONL deps field should be a JSON array

  Scenario: Query with --include-full-path includes file path
    Given a ticket exists with ID "query-001" and title "Path ticket"
    When I run "ticket query --include-full-path"
    Then the command should succeed
    And the output should be valid JSONL
    And the JSONL output should have field "full_path"
    And the output should contain "query-001.md"

  Scenario: Query with --include-full-path and jq filter
    Given a ticket exists with ID "query-001" and title "Open path ticket"
    And a ticket exists with ID "query-002" and title "Closed path ticket"
    And ticket "query-002" has status "closed"
    When I run "ticket query --include-full-path '.status == \"open\"'"
    Then the command should succeed
    And the JSONL output should have field "full_path"
    And the output should contain "query-001"
    And the output should not contain "query-002"

  Scenario: Query without --include-full-path excludes file path
    Given a ticket exists with ID "query-001" and title "No path ticket"
    When I run "ticket query"
    Then the command should succeed
    And the output should not contain "full_path"
