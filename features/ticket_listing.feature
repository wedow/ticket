Feature: Ticket Listing
  As a user
  I want to list tickets in various ways
  So that I can see what work needs to be done

  Background:
    Given a clean tickets directory

  Scenario: List all tickets
    Given a ticket exists with ID "list-0001" and title "First ticket"
    And a ticket exists with ID "list-0002" and title "Second ticket"
    When I run "ticket ls"
    Then the command should succeed
    And the output should contain "list-0001"
    And the output should contain "list-0002"

  Scenario: List command alias works
    Given a ticket exists with ID "list-0001" and title "First ticket"
    When I run "ticket list"
    Then the command should succeed
    And the output should contain "list-0001"

  Scenario: List shows ticket format correctly
    Given a ticket exists with ID "list-0001" and title "My ticket"
    When I run "ticket ls"
    Then the command should succeed
    And the output should match pattern "list-0001\s+\[open\]\s+-\s+My ticket"

    When I run "ticket ls -t epic"
    Then the command should succeed
    And the output should contain "list-0001"
    And the output should not contain "list-0002"
    And the output should contain "list-0003"

    And a ticket exists with ID "list-0002" and title "Closed ticket"
    And ticket "list-0002" has status "closed"
    When I run "ticket ls --status=open"
    Then the command should succeed
    And the output should contain "list-0001"
    And the output should not contain "list-0002"

  Scenario: List shows dependencies
    Given a ticket exists with ID "list-0001" and title "Main ticket"
    And a ticket exists with ID "list-0002" and title "Dep ticket"
