# Port feature id_resolution to TypeScript

Implement the id_resolution functionality. Add this line to typescript/bdd.sh:

```bash
# Run id_resolution feature tests
bun test features/id_resolution.feature
```

## Notes

**2026-01-10T01:15:09Z**

Implemented show, status, and dep commands in TypeScript. All id_resolution tests pass.
