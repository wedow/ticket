# Improve Go implementation project layout

Clean up Go implementation project structure and documentation to match best practices and Python implementation standards.

Tasks:
1. Add go/ticket/.gitignore with:
   - bin/
   - *.test
   - *.out
   - .DS_Store
   
2. Remove tracked binary from git:
   - git rm --cached go/ticket/bin/ticket
   
3. Add go/ticket/README.md with:
   - Project description
   - Build instructions (go build ./cmd/ticket)
   - Test instructions (go test ./...)
   - Development section with linting/formatting
   - Match style of python/ticket/README.md

Verification:
- Run 'make go-check' to ensure everything still works
- Run 'go/bdd.sh' to verify BDD tests pass
- Run './go_ticket.sh help' to verify wrapper works
- Check 'git status' to confirm binary is no longer tracked


## Notes

**2026-01-09T19:46:01Z**

Completed all tasks: Added .gitignore with bin/, *.test, *.out, .DS_Store; removed tracked binary from git; added README.md following python implementation style with build, test, and development instructions. All verification commands passed: go-type, go-test, BDD tests, and wrapper script.
