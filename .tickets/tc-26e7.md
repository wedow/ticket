# Manual smoke test of Go port

Perform manual testing of the Go implementation in a real-world usage scenario.

## Tasks

1. Create a fresh temporary directory
2. Initialize a new ticket repository in that directory
3. Test basic workflows manually:
   - Creating tickets with various options
   - Viewing tickets (show command)
   - Updating ticket status
   - Adding notes to tickets
   - Adding dependencies between tickets
   - Listing tickets with various filters
   - Querying tickets
   - Testing edge cases (invalid IDs, cycles, etc.)
4. Verify the CLI is user-friendly:
   - Error messages are helpful
   - Command output is clear and readable
   - Commands behave intuitively
5. Document any issues found during testing
6. Add notes with test results and observations
7. Confirm the Go implementation works well in actual usage


## Notes

**2026-01-09T18:16:46Z**

Manual smoke testing completed successfully. Tested all major functionality:

✅ Create tickets with various options (description, design, acceptance, type, priority, assignee, external-ref, parent)
✅ Show command displays tickets with blockers, blocking, children, and linked sections
✅ Status updates (start, close, reopen, status command)
✅ Add notes (both with arguments and via stdin)
✅ Dependencies (dep, undep, dep tree with --full flag)
✅ Links (link, unlink, multiple tickets at once)
✅ Listing (ls, ready, blocked, closed with --limit)
✅ Query with jq filters
✅ Partial ID matching
✅ Edge cases: invalid IDs, ambiguous IDs, invalid status, non-existent dependencies
✅ Duplicate dependency/link detection works correctly
✅ Circular dependencies are allowed but handled gracefully (tree display avoids infinite loops)

Observations:
- Error messages are clear and helpful
- CLI is user-friendly and intuitive  
- Parent field in show displays parent title as inline comment
- Show command intelligently organizes related tickets in sections
- File format is clean with proper YAML frontmatter
- All ticket types work (bug, feature, task, epic, chore)
- Default values work correctly (Untitled, git user.name)

No major issues found. The Go implementation is production-ready!
