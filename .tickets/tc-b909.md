# Scope out BDD C

Create individual tickets for each BDD feature to be ported to C implementation.

For each feature in features/, create a ticket with priority 2 in this order:

1. ticket_creation - Foundation
2. ticket_show - Basic display
3. ticket_status - Simple operations
4. ticket_listing - More complex queries
5. ticket_notes - Depends on show
6. ticket_edit - Depends on show
7. ticket_dependencies - Depends on show and listing
8. ticket_links - Similar to dependencies
9. ticket_query - Depends on listing
10. id_resolution - Depends on query

Each ticket should include:
- Implement the feature functionality in C
- Add feature test to c/bdd.sh

Example for each feature:
./ticket create "Port feature <feature_name> to C" -p 2 -d "Implement <feature_name> functionality. Add to c/bdd.sh:
behave features/<feature_name>.feature"
