# Spec review vs C implementation

Compare C implementation against docs/SPEC.md and document findings.

Tasks:
- Review each command in the specification
- Test edge cases:
  - Empty ticket repository
  - Invalid ticket IDs
  - Circular dependencies
  - Concurrent file access
  - Large dependency trees
- Compare behavior with reference bash implementation
- Document findings in docs/SPEC_REVIEW_C.md

Include in review:
  - All commands implemented
  - Command behavior matches spec
  - Error messages are appropriate
  - Sorting and ordering match requirements
  - Memory management is correct
  - No resource leaks
