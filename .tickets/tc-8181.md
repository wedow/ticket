# Manual smoke test of C port

Perform manual validation of the C implementation in real-world scenarios.

Test cases:
- Create a fresh temporary directory
- Initialize with creating several tickets
- Test workflows:
  - Creating tickets with various options
  - Viewing tickets (show, ls)
  - Updating status (start, close, reopen)
  - Adding dependencies and viewing dep trees
  - Adding links between tickets
  - Listing with filters (ready, blocked, closed)
  - Querying with jq filters
  - Adding notes to tickets
  - Editing tickets

- Verify memory leaks with valgrind:
  valgrind --leak-check=full ./c_ticket.sh <command>

- Document any issues found
