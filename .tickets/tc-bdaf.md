# Update AGENTS.md

Use `./tickets ls` to show what's been done, these changes may not be reflected in the AGENTS.MD. Look at some of those tickets `./ticket show <ID>` and browse dir and code if needed.

## Notes

**2026-01-11T01:05:23Z**

Updated AGENTS.md to reflect four language ports (Python, Go, TypeScript, Zig). Added sections documenting: language port architecture, wrapper scripts, BDD test suites, spec review documents, and the NEW_IMPLEMENTATION.md porting guide. All BDD tests pass.

**2026-01-11T01:06:00Z**

Verified by running full BDD test suite (101 scenarios, 703 steps, all passed). Changes committed to git.
