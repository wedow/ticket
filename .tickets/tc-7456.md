# Add full BDD suite to Go build

Integrate all BDD tests into the Go build system.

**Note**: This ticket should depend on ALL individual feature port tickets created in tc-3cff. Add those dependencies once the feature tickets are created.

## Tasks

1. Ensure `go/bdd.sh` includes all feature tests
2. Create the BDD test script with proper structure:
   ```bash
   #!/usr/bin/env bash
   set -euo pipefail
   
   PROJECT_ROOT="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/.." && pwd)"
   export TICKET_SCRIPT="${PROJECT_ROOT}/go_ticket.sh"
   
   # Run all features with godog
   godog "${PROJECT_ROOT}/features/"
   ```
3. Add `go-bdd` target to root Makefile
4. Run complete BDD suite and verify all tests pass
5. Ensure BDD suite can be run as part of CI/CD


## Notes

**2026-01-09T17:55:00Z**

Integrated full BDD suite into Go build system: (1) Updated go/bdd.sh to include all 10 feature tests - 7 implemented features pass (ticket_creation, ticket_show, ticket_notes, ticket_status, ticket_listing, ticket_edit, ticket_query). 3 features pending (ticket_links, ticket_dependencies, id_resolution). (2) Added go-bdd target to root Makefile. (3) Tested BDD suite - 69 scenarios and 422 steps pass. (4) Added dependencies on all 10 feature port tickets. BDD suite will fully pass once tc-cd1e, tc-eff4, tc-c5a8 are completed.
