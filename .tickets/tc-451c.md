# Port feature ticket_notes to TypeScript

Implement the ticket_notes functionality. Add this line to typescript/bdd.sh:

```bash
# Run ticket_notes feature tests
bun test features/ticket_notes.feature
```

## Notes

**2026-01-10T01:36:09Z**

Implemented add-note command in TypeScript CLI. Added cmdAddNote function with timestamp support and wired it up in main. Updated bdd.sh to run ticket_notes feature tests. All 7 scenarios passing.
