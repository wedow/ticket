# Add Plan section requirement for features

Features without ## Plan section should not appear in tk ready (unless --open)

## Design

Files: ticket
- Modify cmd_ready:
  1. If --open flag set, skip Plan check
  2. For type=feature tickets, check body contains '## Plan'
  3. If no Plan section, exclude from ready list
- Use grep or awk to detect section presence

## Acceptance Criteria

- Feature without ## Plan not in tk ready
- Feature with ## Plan shows normally
- `tk ready --open` shows features regardless of Plan section
