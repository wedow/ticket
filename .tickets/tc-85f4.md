# Fix dep tree sorting in Zig implementation

Implement subtree depth sorting as per SPEC.md line 105. Currently sorts by array order, should sort by subtree depth (shallowest first) then ID (ascending).


## Notes

**2026-01-09T22:22:58Z**

Implemented subtree depth sorting in Zig implementation. Added calculateSubtreeDepths() function to compute depth for all nodes, and modified printDepTree() to sort children by subtree depth (shallowest first), then by ID (ascending) as per SPEC.md line 105. All BDD tests pass.
