# Lint / checks in Go port

Add linting, type checking, and testing infrastructure to the Go port.

## Tools to Configure
- **Linting**: `golangci-lint` (comprehensive linter)
- **Type checking**: `go vet` (built-in static analysis)
- **Formatting**: `gofmt` / `goimports` (standard formatters)
- **Testing**: `go test` (built-in testing framework)

## Tasks
1. Add linting configuration (`.golangci.yml`)
2. Configure testing framework
3. Add Makefile targets to root `Makefile`:
   - `go`: Main target (runs go-check)
   - `go-check`: Runs all quality checks (lint, type, test)
   - `go-lint`: Runs golangci-lint
   - `go-type`: Runs go vet
   - `go-fmt`: Runs gofmt/goimports
   - `go-test`: Runs go test
4. Verify all checks pass


## Notes

**2026-01-09T17:17:01Z**

Successfully configured linting and testing infrastructure for Go port. Added .golangci.yml with comprehensive linter configuration including errcheck, gosimple, govet, staticcheck, and more. Added Makefile targets: go (runs go-check), go-check (runs lint/type/test), go-lint (golangci-lint), go-type (go vet), go-fmt (gofmt/goimports), and go-test (go test). All checks pass. Also added documentation comment to exported Run function to satisfy linter requirements.
