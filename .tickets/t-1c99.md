# Add status propagation

Auto-bubble needs_testing and closed up the parent chain

## Design

Files: ticket
- Create propagate_status() function that:
  1. Gets parent of current ticket
  2. If no parent, return
  3. Gets all children of parent
  4. For needs_testing: if all children are needs_testing or closed, set parent to needs_testing
  5. For closed: if all children are closed, set parent to closed
  6. Recurse on parent
- Call propagate_status from status update commands (close, testing, status)

## Acceptance Criteria

Setting last sibling to needs_testing auto-updates parent, same for closed, cascades up tree
