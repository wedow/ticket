# Spec review vs Go implementation

Compare the Go implementation against the ticket-cli specification to ensure completeness and correctness.

## Tasks

1. Read through `docs/SPEC.md` carefully
2. Compare each command and feature with the Go implementation:
   - All commands are implemented
   - Command behavior matches specification
   - Edge cases are handled correctly
   - Error messages are appropriate
   - Sorting and ordering match requirements
3. Test edge cases and sorting behavior:
   - Dependency tree sorting by subtree depth
   - Date/time handling
   - YAML formatting
   - Concurrent access handling
4. Compare with the reference bash implementation if needed
5. Document findings in `docs/SPEC_REVIEW_GO.md`:
   - List of discrepancies found
   - Test results
   - Recommendations for improvements
   - Any missing features or bugs
6. Create new tickets for any issues that need to be addressed
7. Add notes with summary of findings
8. Mark complete when review is thorough and documented


## Notes

**2026-01-09T18:22:58Z**

Completed comprehensive spec review of Go implementation. Created docs/SPEC_REVIEW_GO.md with detailed findings. Key findings: (1) dep tree does not sort by subtree depth (same as Python), (2) migrate-beads not implemented (same as Python). All 40 BDD tests pass. Implementation is 95% spec compliant. Recommend fixing dep tree sorting and removing code duplication.
