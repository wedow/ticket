# Port feature id_resolution to Zig

Implement the id_resolution functionality. Add this line to zig/bdd.sh:

```bash
# Run id_resolution feature tests
behave features/id_resolution.feature
```

## Notes

**2026-01-09T20:55:01Z**

Implemented ID resolution for Zig. Added handleShow (displays ticket content), handleStatus (updates status field), and handleLink (creates symmetric links). Also added updateYAMLScalarField helper for updating scalar frontmatter fields. All id_resolution.feature tests now pass.
