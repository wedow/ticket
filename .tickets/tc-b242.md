# Review project layout
Review the project laybout for go and python implementations. Keep basic go/ and python/ but assume free reign beyond that. If there should be changes, create one ticket per language (using ./ticket), and include directives to check things still work (make targets, `go_ticket.sh`, `bdd.sh` etc.

## Notes

**2026-01-09T19:42:35Z**

Reviewed project layout for Go and Python implementations:

**Go Implementation (go/ticket/):**
- Structure: Good - follows standard Go layout (cmd/, internal/)
- Has: go.mod, .golangci.yml, working Makefile targets
- Wrapper: go_ticket.sh works correctly
- BDD: go/bdd.sh present and functional
- Tests: Unit tests pass

Issues found:
1. Compiled binary go/ticket/bin/ticket is tracked in git (bad for cross-platform)
2. No .gitignore in go/ticket/ to exclude build artifacts
3. No README.md in go/ticket/ (unlike python/ticket/)

**Python Implementation (python/ticket/):**
- Structure: Good - follows modern Python src layout
- Has: pyproject.toml, uv.lock, README.md, .gitignore
- Build artifacts (.venv, caches) correctly NOT tracked
- Wrapper: py_ticket.sh works correctly
- BDD: python/bdd.sh present and functional
- Tests: Unit tests pass

Issues found (minor):
1. .gitignore could include .mypy_cache/, .ruff_cache/ explicitly (though they work due to internal .gitignore)
2. .python-version is tracked (may cause version conflicts)

Both implementations follow language best practices. Main concerns are Go binary tracking and missing documentation consistency.

**2026-01-09T19:43:04Z**

Created improvement tickets:
- tc-b709: Improve Go implementation project layout (priority 2)
  - Add .gitignore
  - Remove tracked binary
  - Add README.md
  - Verify make targets, bdd.sh, go_ticket.sh
  
- tc-db24: Improve Python implementation .gitignore (priority 3)
  - Add cache directory patterns
  - Document .python-version decision
  - Verify make targets, bdd.sh, py_ticket.sh

Overall assessment: Both implementations are well-structured and follow language best practices. The Go implementation needs some cleanup for git tracking and documentation consistency. Python implementation is in good shape with only minor .gitignore enhancements needed.
