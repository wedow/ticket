# 'tk show' add support for multiple tickets in one command

Prevent Claude Code from doing this:

Bash(tk show t-4dfc && echo "---" && tk show t-5771 && echo "---" && tk show t-b3ba)

By supporting this syntax 'tk show t-4dfc, t-5771, t-b3ba' and include a '---' separator between tickets for reading clarity.
