# Add full BDD suite to Zig build

Integrate the complete BDD test suite into the Zig build process.

**Dependencies**: This ticket should depend on ALL individual feature port tickets created by tc-ba73 (the scoping ticket). Once those tickets are created, add them as dependencies using:

```bash
./ticket dep tc-794f <feature-ticket-id>
```

**Tasks**:
1. Verify zig/bdd.sh includes all feature tests
2. Run the complete BDD suite and ensure all tests pass
3. Add Makefile target `zig-bdd` to the root Makefile
4. Ensure the BDD suite can be run as part of CI/CD
5. Document any issues found and fixed

**Makefile target** (add to root Makefile):

```makefile
zig-bdd:
	@echo "Running Zig BDD tests..."
	bash zig/bdd.sh
```

**The zig/bdd.sh script should include all features:**

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

PROJECT_ROOT="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/.." && pwd)"
export TICKET_SCRIPT="${PROJECT_ROOT}/zig_ticket.sh"

# Run all feature tests
behave "${PROJECT_ROOT}/features/ticket_creation.feature"
behave "${PROJECT_ROOT}/features/ticket_show.feature"
behave "${PROJECT_ROOT}/features/ticket_status.feature"
behave "${PROJECT_ROOT}/features/ticket_listing.feature"
behave "${PROJECT_ROOT}/features/ticket_notes.feature"
behave "${PROJECT_ROOT}/features/ticket_edit.feature"
behave "${PROJECT_ROOT}/features/ticket_dependencies.feature"
behave "${PROJECT_ROOT}/features/ticket_links.feature"
behave "${PROJECT_ROOT}/features/ticket_query.feature"
behave "${PROJECT_ROOT}/features/id_resolution.feature"
```
